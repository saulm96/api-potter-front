Basic navigation and footer completed. Started working on the modal for login/register (it won't be functional for now, just focusing on creating the components).

Added a Modal component for login/registration. It still needs some styling to be considered finished.
Finishing the styles isn’t a Tier 1 priority right now, so I will keep working on other tasks until it looks visually acceptable.
Started working on the dropdown menu that contains routes for general users. The admin panel will be a button placed next to the dropdown.

With only a few finishing touches left, I’ve moved the dropdown button and the login modal to Tier 1 priority. I will now start working on the title and structure of the Landing Page.



TO-DO LIST:
Priorities ordered from lowest to highest (the higher the number, the higher the priority):

(1) Nav bar Drop down menu:
Animate and finalize the dropdown menu ✅
The final styles for the button still need to be decided. For now, it will be a square, but it will probably need to change in the future.

(1)Login/Register button:
Fix the last style details in the login/register form.
There is a visual bug when clicking the main login button: it scales only at the bottom instead of performing the proper click animation.
Still have to check adaptability to different sizes on screen. It is fixed in theory but would be better to double check in different devices, the problem was with the height
of the modal.
