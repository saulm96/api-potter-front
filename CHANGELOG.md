Basic nav and footer. Started working in the modal for the login/register (It is not gonna be functional for now. Just making the components)

2024/12/18
Added a Modal component for logign/registration. Still needs a bit of style to considered done.
Finishing the styles it's not a tier1 priority now so I will keep working in other things untill get something visually acceptable.
Started working in the drop down menu who contains the routes for the general users. The admin panel will be a button next to the drop down.


TO DO LIST:
Priorities ordered from lowest to highest. The higher the number, the higher the priority:

(3) ==>
Animate and finish the drop down menu



(1)==>
 --Last style details in login/register form.
 There is a visual bug while clicking the main login button. It scales only in the bottom instead of doing the animation of being clicked.
